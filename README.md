# Artificial Neural Networks
A few assignments from PSYCH 489: Neural Network Lab, along with my final project which focused on applying backprop to forecast stock fluctuations. The precision of the model is grossly inflated (in the report) because I didn't know how to check for the model's accuracy at the time. I might revisit this project sometime in the near future.
